Energy Conversation In RAID Disks using Reinforcement Learning

The project aims at conserving the energy in the RAID disks by spinning down the disks not in use.

This is achieved by controlling which disk the files are saved using Reinforcement learning.

Disk sim was used to emulate the RAID disks

The interface folder contains the code used to manage the tasks of the Operating System, i.e., moving the files, allocating memory and keeping track of empty disk spaces
