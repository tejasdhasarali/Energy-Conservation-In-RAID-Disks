# Energy Conservation in Disks Utilizing Related Data Concentration

The project aims at conserving the energy in the RAID disks by using the related data concentration.

The RAID disks were emulated using the DiskSim Simulation Environment by making small modifications.

The web server disk usage traces was collected from the FIU's Computer Science web, email and dev servers.

These web traces were used to simulate the


This is achieved by controlling which disk the files are saved using Reinforcement learning.

Disk sim was used to emulate the RAID disks

The interface folder contains the code used to manage the tasks of the Operating System, i.e., moving the files, allocating memory and keeping track of empty disk spaces
